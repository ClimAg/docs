Jupyter notebooks for the [ClimAg](https://www.ucc.ie/en/eel/projects/climag/) research project

This research was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ireland
project "ClimAg: Multifactorial causes of fodder crises in Ireland and risks
due to climate change" under the Climate Change Research Programme grant
number 2018-CCRP-MS.50.

## Python environment

Create a Conda environment:

```sh
conda env create
conda activate ClimAg
```

To update the environment:

```sh
conda env update --name ClimAg --file environment.yml
```

Windows users should use Conda within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as some packages (e.g. cdo) are unavailable for Windows.
