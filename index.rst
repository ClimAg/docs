ClimAg: Multifactorial causes of fodder crises in Ireland and risks due to climate change
=========================================================================================

About
-----

ClimAg is examining past fodder crises such as the 2018 dry summer and placing them in the context of long-term climate change.

ClimAg seeks to identify the multifactorial drivers of fodder crises by:

* developing a detailed understanding of the multiple interlinked drivers of previous fodder crises affecting the Irish agricultural sector
* combining datasets from 21st century climate simulations with grass growth models to predict the frequency and severity of fodder crisis events under future climate change scenarios

This research project was carried out at the `Environmental Research Institute (ERI) <https://eri.ucc.ie>`_, `University College Cork (UCC) <https://www.ucc.ie>`_ between 2019 and 2023.

ClimAg is a three-year research project funded by the `Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <https://www.epa.ie/>`_ under the Climate Change Research Programme grant number 2018-CCRP-MS.50, with additional funding provided under the COVID-19 research support scheme of the `Higher Education Authority (HEA) <https://hea.ie/>`_.

The Python implementation of the `ModVege <https://code.europa.eu/agri4cast/modvege>`_ pasture model adapted for use in this project was translated from Java to Python by Y. Chemin.
This Python implementation was originally published as public domain software on GitHub under the `Unlicence license <https://github.com/ClimAg/modvege>`_.
The Java model was provided by R. Martin of INRAE UREP Clermont-Ferrand for the original Python implementation.
The original ModVege pasture model was developed by `Jouven et al. <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2006.00515.x>`_
